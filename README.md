A demo of this can be used at https://codesandbox.io/s/layout-app-gol9f

A simple app where you can select one of five preset layouts and fill sections of the layout to see what color combinations work. You can also change the text within those sections to preview what each font looks like (I plan to add on to this in the future i.e. I want to add full text sections to make each layout look like real website templates).

This is my first project playing with React. I utilize the Context API to detect the size of the window and render the layout of the app accordingly and also use it to change the font of the text inside of the layout boxes (though I plan to add on to this in the future). I also play with using custom hooks for hovering, toggling buttons, and finding the bounding rectangle of elements to display modal tooltips using React portals.

In terms of styling, everything is using custom CSS for me to practice using CSS grid, flexbox, mixins, variables, etc. 

**Practiced:**
- React hooks
- Creating custom hooks
- React portals
- State management
- Responsive Design
- Adobe XD (to create SVG's)
